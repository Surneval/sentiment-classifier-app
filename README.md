## Overview

This application fine-tunes a DistilBERT model on the IMDB movie reviews dataset for sentiment classification. It applies Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for more efficient training and logs results to MLflow and Comet.ml. The final model is served via a FastAPI backend, and a Streamlit frontend provides a simple UI for user input.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and split IMDB data into training and validation sets.
- **Training:** Uses `Hugging Face Transformers` and `PEFT` to fine-tune DistilBERT with LoRA.
- **Experiment Tracking:** 
  - **MLflow:** Logs metrics and parameters locally.
  - **Comet.ml:** Provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- **Model Serving:** A FastAPI endpoint for inference.
- **User Interface:** A Streamlit web app to easily test sentiment predictions.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **pip** and **virtualenv** (or `venv`)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (if running via containers)
- **Comet.ml Account** (for experiment tracking integration)
- Sufficient memory and storage for model training and inference.

## Setup and Installation

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surneval/sentiment-classifier-app.git
   cd sentiment-classifier-app
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv my_ml
   source my_ml/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Preprocess the data (optional, if not already done):**
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```
   This will create `train.csv` and `val.csv` in the `data` directory.

### Using Docker and Docker Compose

1. **Build images without cache (if needed):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```
   
2. **Run services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
3. **Check services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   
This will start both the API service and UI.

## Model Training

To train (or retrain) the model from scratch:

1. **Activate your virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source my_ml/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```
   
This will:
- Preprocess the data (if not done).
- Train the model and save it to the `model/` directory.
- Log training metrics to `mlruns/` for MLflow tracking.

## Experiment Tracking with Comet.ml

In addition to MLflow, we have integrated **[Comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/)** for real-time experiment tracking and improved visualization. Comet.ml provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor training runs, compare experiments, and track metrics, parameters, and artifacts.

### Configuration

1. **Create `.env` File in `scripts` Folder**

   Inside the `scripts` directory, create a file named `.env`:

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Populate the `.env` File**

   Open `.env` and add the following (replace the API key and paths as needed):

   ```plaintext
   COMET_API_KEY=YOUR KEY
   COMET_WORKSPACE=YOUR WORKSPACE
   COMET_PROJECT_NAME=general
   MODEL_DIR=.../my_ml_service/model
   ```

   > **Note:** Keep your Comet API key secret and do not commit this file to version control. Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.

### Running the Comet-Enabled Training Script

With the `.env` file configured:

1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already):
   ```bash
   source ../my_ml/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the Comet-enabled training script:
   ```bash
   python train_comet.py
   ```

This script will:

- Load credentials and settings from the `.env` file.
- Log training metrics, parameters, and artifacts to Comet.ml in real-time.
- Allow you to monitor runs on your Comet.ml dashboard.

## Running the Service without Docker

If running locally without Docker:

1. **Activate your virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source my_ml/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Start the FastAPI service:**
   ```bash
   cd service
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. Access the API docs at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

## Running the UI

If not using Docker:

1. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   source my_ml/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit UI:**
   ```bash
   cd ui
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Access the UI at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

## Making Predictions

- **Via the API**:  
  Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/predict` with JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "review": "This movie was absolutely fantastic!"
  }
  ```
  
  You’ll receive a response:
  ```json
  {
    "sentiment": "positive"
  }
  ```

- **Via the UI**:
  Open `http://localhost:8501`, enter a review, and click "Predict".


## Troubleshooting

- **Large File Issues in Git:**  
  If you encounter Git LFS or large file issues, ensure you have Git LFS installed and tracking large files.

- **Missing Dependencies:**
  Run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- **Docker Errors:**
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
  - Check `docker info` to confirm the daemon is active.
  - Try `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up --build`.
  - Try to restart Docker `pkill Docker` and then `open /Applications/Docker.app` and then `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up --build`
  - Modify you Docker Engine the following way:
  `{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "dns": [
    "8.8.8.8",
    "8.8.4.4"
  ],
  "experimental": false
}`

- **Model or Missing Files:**
  If the model files are missing, rerun `python scripts/train.py` or download the model weights as instructed by the project’s documentation.
